# Project 1 Description: 311 Service Requests of City of Vancouver
This is my documentation of the design & implementatio of City of Vancouver Data Analytical Platform by using the free [Source](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/3-1-1-service-requests/information/?disjunctive.department&disjunctive.service_request_type&disjunctive.status&disjunctive.closure_reason&disjunctive.local_area&disjunctive.channel) datasets available in the Open Data portal website of segment 3-1-1 service requests. This project concentrates on details of designing and implementing DAP in detail.

## Project Title: DAP Design & Implementation for 311 Contact Center of City of Vancouver
* Customer initiated service requests received by 3-1-1 Contact Centre from 2022-2024.
* Service requests refer only to those call types that generate a requ​​es​​t to a City of Vancouver department to provide service.
* The City of Vancouver is increasingly leveraging data to improve its operations and services to citizens.
* This document outlines the implementation of an AWS Data Analytic Platform (DAP) designed to address the city's needs in 3-1-1 service request analysis.
* The DAP offers a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for data management, processing, and analysis, empowering city officials to make data-driven decisions for the benefit of Vancouver residents.
## Project Objective:
* To design and implement DAP for City of vancouver's 3-1-1 Service Requests..
## Datasets
* The Dataset used is taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/3-1-1-service-requests/information/?disjunctive.department&disjunctive.service_request_type&disjunctive.status&disjunctive.closure_reason&disjunctive.local_area&disjunctive.channel) for the category of "3-1-1 Service Request metrics"<br>

 This dataset contains location information such as address or intersection where service was requested and the local area corresponding to the case (incident) location.
## Methodology:
* The process involves different steps explained in detail below:
### Step1: Data Analytical Question Formulation
### Step2: Data Discovery
### Step3: Data Storage Design
### Step4: Data Preparation
### Step6: Data Storage
### Step7: Data Pipeline Design
### Step8:	Data Cleaning
### Step9: Data Structuring
### Step10: Data Pipeline Implementation
### Step11:	Data Analysis
### Step 12: Data Visualization
### Step 13: Data Publishing
### Step14: Cost Estimation

# Project Description: Descriptive Analysis of 311 Service Center
This assignment is continuation for improvement of the [AWS-Part1-Venkat](https://venkat-ramana-reddy-bhoom-reddy.github.io/AWS-Part1-Venkat/) project using the datasets taken from  website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/3-1-1-service-requests/information/?disjunctive.department&disjunctive.service_request_type&disjunctive.status&disjunctive.closure_reason&disjunctive.local_area&disjunctive.channel). This project concentrates on details of protection, governance and monitoring of DAP.

## Project Title: Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP
This project concentrates on details of protection, governance and monitoring of DAP. As these 3 are vital thing that must be ensured for all the current project. Lack of any of these three aspects would result in the project execution lacking or even failure of the project. We will see how below:
## Project Objective:
* Data Protection design and implementation.
* Data Governance design and implementation.
* Data Monitoring design and implementation.
## Datasets
* The Dataset used is taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/3-1-1-service-requests/information/?disjunctive.department&disjunctive.service_request_type&disjunctive.status&disjunctive.closure_reason&disjunctive.local_area&disjunctive.channel) for the category of "3-1-1 service request metrics"<br>

* This dataset contains location information such as address or intersection where service was requested and the local area corresponding to the case (incident) location.
## Methodology:
* The process involves 3 different steps explained in detail below:
### Step 15: Data Protection
### Step 16: Data Governance
### Step 17: Data Monitoring
